            <span class="roboto-bold">Alucard Story</span>
            <span class="titleStory" id="roboto-bold-italic">Demon hunter who detest the darkness</span>
            <br>
            Alucard's father was a comrade-in-arms of Tigreal who disappeared in a battle with the Demons. Therefore, he hated darkness, joined the Monastery of Light, and swore to destory all Demons. But later he learned the hidden secrets of this battle, so he left the Monastery of Light in anger and fought the darkness in his own way.
            <span class="subTitle">Lore</span>
            The last great war is a glorious memory for the Moniyans. The powerful Light's Order, together with the Imperial Border Guards, wiped out the demonic strongholds at the Moniyan and the Barren Lands pass, driving the fiends back to the hinterlands of the Forsaken Wastes. But for young Alucard, the war was nothing but a terrible memory of pain and misery. His father's second regiment suffered heavy losses due to a rash lone advance. Alucard's father disappeared in the battle and was later declared dead by the Light's Order.
            As they had disobeyed orders, the second regiment was not honored and praised for their sacrifice but labeled "disobedient" and criticized for their lack of discipline. This was a huge blow to Alucard, who had always regarded his father as a hero and role model. Facing shame and ridicule everywhere he went, the flames of revenge burned within his chest, and he became determined to bring honor to his father's name and eliminate all the demons in the Land of Dawn. And so, he left his hometown and journeyed to the ancient and mysterious Monastery of Light. As the orphaned son of a dead soldier, Alucard was soon accepted into the Monastery of Light.
            In the following years, Alucard studied a range of combat skills in the Monastery of Light. With his natural talent and undying determination, he soon became the most promising student among his peers. During his training, Tigreal, The Commander of the Light's Order, who had once fought in the second regiment with his father, often visited Alucard in the Monastery of Light, teaching him various advanced combat skills and telling him of his father's heroic deeds.
            Tigreal was already famous throughout the Empire at that time, and Alucard respected him greatly, regarding him as an elder brother of sorts. However, whenever he mentioned his father's final battle, Tigreal always fell silent, his eyes filled with a wave of complex emotions. Alucard was skeptical of the idea that his father had died in battle. He was convinced that his father was still alive and was waiting for him somewhere
            At the age of eighteen, Alucard finally completed all of his studies and formal preparations. Encouraged by Tigreal, he became the monastery's Arbiter of Light. He was ordered to go forth and eliminate the demons and heretics hidden throughout the world, and so he picked up his father's old sword, given to him by Tigreal, and set off. In his father's name, and fueled by his deep hatred of demons, Alucard soon became the greatest demon hunter in the world.
            An unforeseen incident occurred during a demon hunting operation on the border of the Barren Lands. Alucard was injured by a magic blade, sustaining a wound that could not be healed. Darkness poured into his body from the wound, and his arm began to undergo a strange transformation... In order to prevent the mutation from spreading throughout his whole body, Alucard asked an old smith to help him forge a pair of gauntlets. This was no ordinary smith — he was a survivor of that fated battle, a member of the Light's Order who covered his allies' retreat along with Alucard's father.
            He recognized the huge sword in Alucard's hand. After learning who he was, the old man told Alucard that the reason the second regiment was forced so deep into enemy territory was that the high-level knights at that time were greedy for glory and too impulsive, which led to the second regiment finding itself trapped in a tight encirclement. In a moment of desperation, Alucard's father led some soldiers to cover the retreat of the main force headed by Tigreal, and was then swarmed by a tide of demons and disappeared. He was the only survivor rescued by Alucard's father.
            After learning the truth, Alucard returned to the capital and questioned Tigreal about the battle and why he hadn't told him what had really happened that day. Seeing the anger gripping Alucard, Tigreal confessed the guilt he felt for abandoning his allies and the silence he was forced to maintain at the behest of his family. He expressed his willingness to make up for it in any way he could, claiming that he would give his own life if he had to. However, before Tigreal, who was once like a brother to him, the young Alucard was entangled in a web of confusion. He couldn't bear to kill Tigreal, but he couldn't forgive him either.
            For the sake of his father's honor, Alucard asked the Empire to reveal the truth of the second regiment and restore his father's name. However, the knights of that battle had become some of the most powerful figures in the Empire. They refused Alucard's request and drove him out of the capital. On top of this, the puritanical Monastery of Light was strongly against Alucard's unnatural right hand, repeatedly making trouble for him and even calling him a heretic. For the longest time, Alucard's deep hatred of the demons and his desire to regain his father's honor had spurred him on in his mission to serve as the Arbiter of Light. But now, faced with the Empire that had betrayed his father, and a church that treated him with scorn, Alucard made an unthinkable decision: To betray the Monastery of Light and fight for himself.
            In the following years, Alucard began wandering the Land of Dawn, annihilating demons everywhere he went on his own terms and searching for clues as to his father's whereabouts. His demonic right hand not only brought him great strength, but also became an unstable element which he was forced to hide under his heavy armor every day.
            After a string of epic battles, Alucard became known as one of the most legendary fighters in Moniyan. Soon, everyone knew that wherever demons ran rampant, the demon hunter with the dark right hand would no doubt descend from the sky and leave nonalive.

                <span class="roboto-bold">Fredrinn Story</span>
                <span class="titleStory" id="roboto-bold-italic">A master treasure appraiser in Los Pecados who accumulates wealth to search for his best friend.</span>
                <br>
                Born the son of Duke Vance, Fredrinn grew up into a gifted adventurer, but also the notorious 'money-grubber' in Los Pecados. The crystal in his chest had long merged with his heart. The terrifying scar would never fade, and Fredrinn never bothered to conceal it. All he had in mind was his search for his lost friend...
                <span class="subTitle">Lore</span>
                "Be a darlin' an' pour me a shot of your signature drink," the drunken tramp slurred at the bartender. "An' I'mma tell y'all the truth 'bout that bastard Fredrinn!"
                People in Los Pecados had long since memorized tales about Fredrinn, but his name was still like a siren call, alluring anyone who'd heard it toward its source.
                "Two shots for our good friend," a young smuggler spoke up, tossing a handful of pennies onto the counter.
                "Ahh, mighty fine gentleman. I'll make it worth yer while I assure ya. This one's somethin' ya'll 'ave never heard of!" The tramp exclaimed.
                Everyone in the bar had their eyes on the grimy tramp, save for the man drinking alone in the hidden corner, a compass clenched tightly in his hand.
                "The story begins over a dozen years ago," the tramp commenced, sounding surprisingly sober after taking a swig of his drink. "After receivin' his fief, Duke Vance of Castle Grandrock opened up the seaborne trade route to Northern Vale. Merchant ships from the north…all laden with rare produce…and all tradin' exclusively with the Duke. Why, the old weasel was practically bathin' in profits!"
                The tramp took another gulp, looking around at the greasy faces eagerly waiting for the next part.
                "But riches and prestige gave the Duke little pleasure," he continued. "If any, this newfound wealth only served to stir in 'im an even greater desire: To climb to the very top of the Imperial nobility. The Duke began to discipline his children with stringent rules, punishin' any child who dared disobey his words."
                "For once, I'm damn glad I ain't some rich codger's son!" the smuggler interjected.
                "Aye, an' you wouldn't be alone," the tramp replied. "One of the Vance boys gave the Duke an endless headache. This young'n had no interest in the rules and etiquettes of the nobles, and had a hankering for freedom and adventure. The Duke didn't want the brat's nasty ideas infectin' the other children's minds. So, he arranged for the boy to study at the Monastery of Light."
                "Pretty convenient excuse to suck up to the Monastery's Archbishop!" the barkeep chimed in.
                "Well, you'd be right," the tramp replied. "As the Duke was in dire need of stronger political allies. The boy, however…had other plans. Havin' overheard his father's arrangement, the little rascal decided to sneak outta the Castle and sail off on a so-called adventure of his own."
                "I reckon the Duke wouldn't have much to worry 'bout, though," the smuggler butted in again. "Spoiled little brat like 'im, he'd soon be running back to his daddy!"
                "Aye, the Duke figured as much," the tramp responded. "Old Vance was bloody livid, but didn't even bother lookin' for his boy!
                "The brat, however, proved far more robust than his father thought. He was no adventurer, mind ya; but with his courage, wit, and excellent judgment, the boy slipped through every obstacle that came his way. He had a particular fondness for exploring the most treacherous areas still uncharted by man.
                "And soon, his name spread throughout the Land of Dawn. Yet, no one knew about his past life."
                The tramp took a long pause, as if waiting for someone to respond. But all he got were blank faces and some glazed-over eyes.
                "Oh, y'all gotta be kiddin' me…" he grunted with a sigh and a roll of his eyes. "The boy was Fredrinn…Fredrinn Vance!"
                His revelation was met with yet another round of silence. But as realization dawned upon his audience, the tavern erupted into an uproar.
                "Fredrinn…a nobleman!? Why, the punk's a bloody crook!" A burly man with a horned helmet cut in, his eyes bulging they almost popped off their sockets.
                "No one knows that money-grubber better than me!" The man exclaimed. "No matter how much you prepare in advance, the bloodsucker will always ask for a higher price. Why, a gang boss himself barged into his shop to personally deliver his payment, loaded pistol pointed right between Fredrinn's eyebrows. Bastard didn't even flinch…and instead, asked for more money!"
                The young smuggler raised his hand, "But is it true what they say about 'im? 'No-question-an'-no-disclosure policy' 'bout his appraisal of hunted treasures?"
                "Aye," the burly man replied. "Don't matter who you are, the scoundrel sticks to his guns. Ain't no compelling him, not even by force. What you gon' do, raid his treasure shop? Get yerself ready for a beatin' then—per the customs of Los Pecados. And if you're lucky enough to wake up, all damaged items must be paid in double, not a single dime less—"
                "Come on, we all know about those!" the tramp cried out, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "But what about Fredrinn's secret!? That crystal lodged in his chest—"
                The crowd fell eerily silent, only to erupt into wild cheers moments later. Even the barkeep poured another shot for the tramp to keep him talking. "The crystal is said to come from the ruins of a lost civilization. It seals an ancient power coveted even by the King of Abyss. Fredrinn went to great lengths to get his hands on this crystal, even killin' his own partner in this process—"
                The man sitting in the corner walked over, interrupting the tramp's words.
                His brawny frame towered over everyone in the tavern. His eyes burned with disdain, as he gazed upon the lesser men surrounding him. Embedded in his scarred chest, right at the place of his heart, a strange crystal pulsated with a ghostly glow.
                "F-F-Fredrinn…" the tramp and the burly man stuttered in awe.
                The tin wine box in Fredrinn's hand creaked as his fist clutched.
                "A wonderful story, my friend," Fredrinn stated calmly. "However, if I hear anyone say I killed my partner again…I'll come to his door and give him a thorough appraisal."
                Fredrinn walked out of the bar after those words, his blood and memory surging through him.
                The shrewd and revered treasure appraiser of Los Pecados was once a passionate and adventurous boy who wanted to escape his noble status. Always at his side was a friend who'd go through anything with him…Fray.
                Except, Fray was gone.
                On their last adventure together, the two stumbled upon an ancient altar. A giant crystal hovered at its center, radiating with an ominous glow.
                Fray warned his partner, but the young and reckless Fredrinn couldn't escape the allure. He approached the altar and laid his hand on the crystal, disrupting the balance of an ancient ward in the process.
                A ghostly figure in a black cloak emerged from the center of the altar.
                "…You two will be the final offering"
                Those were the last words Fray and Fredrinn heard before the altar began to collapse under the weight of ancient magic, trapping the two amidst the chaos.
                "Fredrinn…this time, it's my turn to save you…"
                Fray, who'd always hidden behind Fredrinn, picked up a shard of the crystal and pressed it against Fredrinn's chest, giving up to him the only chance of survival. The power of the crystal integrated with Fredrinn's own and protected him from the collapse. But when he looked up, he found Fray and the ruins both gone without a trace. The only thing left was Fray's magic compass.
                Fredrinn found a new quest the moment he opened the compass. The blue pointer recorded Fray's trace of life. It spun wildly and vibrated like tiny heartbeats.
                Fray's still alive!
                To look for clues that could lead to Fray's whereabouts, Fredrinn stayed in Los Pecados as a treasure appraiser. He accumulated his funds to build a vast intelligence network that gathered any knowledge related to the ruins.
                The cost didn't matter.
                Standing in front of a wall of clues, Fredrinn stared at the magic compass in his hand.
                "As long as the pointer's still spinning, I will not give up."

                <br>
                Yu Zhong, the conqueror born from the Black Dragon's power, sought to break the seal on the Reverse Scale hidden within the Dragon Altar and forge a new future for the Cadia Riverlands. However, he was defeated by his senior brother, Baxia, and left to die in the mountains. After ten years of arduous training and travel, Yu Zhong found himself back at the Dragon Altar. He faced off against the Oriental Fighters, broke the seal to the Reverse Scale, and clashed in a final battle with the Evil God, Lieh, who caused the demise of the previous Black Dragon. Ultimately, with the help of his dear friend Wanwan, Yu Zhong regained his true self and emerged victorious. Now with the Black Dragon's Reverse Scale restored, Yu Zhong sets off on his path of conquest.

                <span class="subTitle">Lore</span>
                During the age of the Endless War, the last of the dragon race, the Black and White Dragon Twins, opened a path to the Cadia Riverlands to save their people from lation.onion.
                However, their journey would be paved with many sacrifices, including the Black Dragon himself. To stop the pursuit of the Evil God, Lieh, the exhausted Black Dragon made a last stand and swallowed Lieh in the battle. But in doing so, he also sealed his own fate.
                Lieh laid dormant for millennia as the Cadia Riverlands enjoyed peace and prosperity. From within, he slowly corrupted the Black Dragon until finally plunging him into darkness. Under Lieh's influence, the Black Dragon sought to use the Yin Yang Eye to expand his dark power. The war that ensued shook the heavens themselves, until eventually, the White Dragon incarnated into the Dragon Altar to vanquish his corrupted brother. Baxia was the only Oriental Fighter to survive the war.
                From then on, the Black Dragon's name became taboo, and the White Dragon became known as the Great Dragon. Thirty-five years ago, Baxia learned that the Black Dragon's power had reincarnated as a boy. However, when Baxia tracked him down, he could not bring himself to harm the innocent child.Baxia informed the parents that their son bore the destiny of leading the Cadia Riverlands and must be taken to the Dragon Altar to receive the Great Dragon's guidance. While shedding tears of joy and sorrow, the couple agreed and named the boy "Yu Zhong," hoping he would one day soar to the heavens.
                Why do people always yearn for heroes to save them? What made them so weak that they could not even protect their loved ones from disaster? The Great Dragon had always indulged in the dream of an idyllic Cadia Riverlands. He entrusted his disciples to be the guardians of the land so the people could forget the past and move forward. But if an unfathomable calamity were to arise, what would happen to this land?
                The shadow of the Black Dragon began to swell in Yu Zhong's eyes, and inexplicable voices whispered of ancient memories that did not belong to him. The Black Dragon's power, aligned with Yin energy, was his birthright.Yu Zhong was destined to reclaim the Black Dragon's power and guide the world toward his ideals: the people must be forged by fire into warriors who could rise and defend the Cadia Riverlands against future crises. And to achieve that end, great sacrifices were required.
                With this newfound determination, Yu Zhong entered the Forbidden Area of the Dragon Soul.When Baxia arrived to stop him, instead of fear or hesitation, Yu Zhong felt a sense of liberation. The two had never seen eye to eye, and now they could finally settle their differences in a clash of fists.For the first time, the two disciples fought each other with all their might. Yu Zhong, lacking the experience of his senior, was eventually knocked down from the mountaintop by Baxia and disappeared into the thick forest below.
                Nearly succumbing to his injuries, Yu Zhong was saved by the unlikeliest of people: a cheerful young girl named Wanwan from the Tang clan. Recognizing the power of the White Tiger within her, Yu Zhong was initially tempted to eliminate this possible threat to the Black Dragon, but he realized those sinister thoughts were not his own.
                Wanwan, unaware of Yu Zhong's inner conflict, treated him as a friend while Yu Zhong would occasionally give her guidance as her senior. Yu Zhong's draconian ideals were continuously being worn down by the pure-hearted girl until his true aspirations were revealed: through conquest, he would create a world of harmony, free of evil, where everyone could live with childlike innocence.
                Years later, the spirit master Luo Yi would find Yu Zhong and take him on the next step of his journey. Before departing, Yu Zhong sealed a part of his true self into a dragon orb and p
                However, the calamity that once led to the Black Dragon's demise—the Evil God, Lieh—also emerged from the seal, intending to corrupt Yu Zhong's heart as he had done to the Black Dragon.But Yu Zhong was not the former Black Dragon, and he would not abandon his emotions and personal desires. If he could not even hold onto his true self, what right did he have to offer freedom to the world?
                Even so, engaging in a clash of willpower with a god was akin to a death sentence. After just a few rounds, Lieh seemed poised to crush Yu Zhong's will once and for all. But at this critical moment, Wanwan, who had long sensed something wrong with the dragon orb and used it to locate the Dragon Altar, was able to bypass the seal and enter the Forbidden Area. She rushed towards the battle, hoping to stop Yu Zhong and bring him back to his senses.
                As she approached, a burst of light suddenly shot out from the dragon orb toward Yu Zhong. Everything had gone according to his plan. The light containing his true self reinfused with Yu Zhong, allowing him to regain control for a split second, and that moment was all he needed to expel Lieh's consciousness from his body. With this victory over the Evil God, Yu Zhong unleashed a thunderous roar as he claimed his rightful power.
                Wanwan's kindness and innocence had played a vital role in the realization of Yu Zhong's ambitions. He knew she would find him, and purposely gave her a portion of his true self in his bid to defeat Lieh. But did he consider how using the girl's innocence to further his own ends would affect her? Or perhaps this was deemed a necessary "sacrifice"?Only Yu Zhong himself knew the answers to these questions. But what the world did know was this: At that moment, Yu Zhong had truly become the Black Dragon.
                A great change was coming to the Cadia Riverlands, a change that was long overdue.
                Yu Zhong is about to be fully controlled by the consciousness of the Black Dragon [on] the reverse scale and fall into madness. At this critical moment, Wanwan takes out the keepsake once belonging to Yu Zhong, which is the primordial spirit with dim luster.
                Wanwan has never doubted Yu Zhong's true nature. She firmly believes that Yu Zhong is not as heinous as everyone thinks and his mind has been devoured by the reverse scale. As long as the primordial spirit returns, Yu Zhong can change back to what he used to be. She rushes to Yu Zhong, who is out of control and insane, with the primordial spirit, and puts it into Yu Zhong's body. After a strong light, he starts recovering his sanity and has also recognized the grown-up Tang Wanwan.
                Yu Zhong turns to Wanwan, who is looking at himself expectantly. A complex look comes into his eyes. To everyone's surprise, Yu Zhong doesn't expel the reverse scale from his body but completely combines the primordial spirit and it. After recovering sanity, Yu Zhong not only has prevented the ancient Black Dragon from devouring his own consciousness and mastered all reverse scale's power, but also can transform between the two forms of the dragon and the human, and become a real Fierce Dragon.
                All of these are actually part of his plan. He took advantage of Wanwan's kindness and simplicity to let her keep the primordial spirit which could decide his destiny, and at this moment completed all his plans by making use of her unconditional trust.
                The reverse scale returns, and the Black Dragon appears. He no longer has any weakness, and founding hegemonies is the only goal for him. He soars up into the sky in black dragon form.
                Luo Yi stares madly at the black dragon flying in the sky. She knows that her long-cherished wish has finally come true and a new era is coming.
                [The world will only remember the name of whoever is strong and won't query his original intention.] He will conquer every land of Cadia Riverlands and wait for the ultimate duel with the Great Dragon.

                <span class="roboto-bold">Zilong Story</span>
                <span class="titleStory" id="roboto-bold-italic">Descendant of the Great Dragon, guards the Cadia Riverlands.</span>
                <br>
                The young Zilong was separated from his family in an accident and was later taken in by the Great Dragon, where practiced with Ling in the secret realm of the Dragon Altar, eventually becoming the hair of the Great Dragon, taking on the important task of protecting the Cadia Riverlands.
                <span class="subTitle">Profil</span>
                A righteous warrior, who has swore to protect the Cadia Riverlands. His outstanding ability and steadfast faith has made him the Great Dragon's spokesman and also his favorite apprentice. The soul of the Oriental Fighters.
                <span class="subTitle">Lore</span>
                Zilong was born in the quiet and peaceful Cadia Riverlands. In his limited memory, he remembered his father being a craftsman who drifted around the land. Every year, as the seasons changed, he traveled back and forth between the north and south, while Zilong's mother held their young child in her arms with a smile, sitting in their carriage, watching Zilong's father yelling all the way.
                But that's where the memories of his parents ended. On the way to their next destination, a violent wind struck and destroyed their carriage, scaring away the horses pulling them along. After the wind subsided, the young Zilong found himself alone, his parents nowhere to be found. In his helplessness, the young Zilong wandered across the desolate wastelands for seven days. Through his despair and the countless difficulties that befell him, Zilong showed resilience and potential far beyond any ordinary person, and never gave up in his quest for survival. When Zilong was on the verge of utter exhaustion, a white-bearded old man with wide robes and gaping sleeves floated down to him and brought him to a mysterious place.
                After ascending a seemingly endless flight of steps, Zilong came to the magnificent temple of the Great Dragon. He was taken in by the Great Dragon and lived at the Dragon Altar for seven years.
                After these seven years, the Great Dragon, who had not accepted any more apprentices for many years, announced that he would choose a successor from either Zilong or Ling. However, the Great Dragon did not select the winner of the contest, the considerably more talented Ling, as his successor. Instead, he chose Zilong, who lacked the skill of his peer.
                Everyone was surprised and puzzled by the Great Dragon's decision. The adherents of the Dragon Altar all questioned the strength of this ordinary young man, and why the Great Dragon had chosen him as his successor. Only the Great Dragon knew of the potential that lay within the seemingly ordinary Zilong. Among his adherents, the strongest would always compete to exhibit their strength and the underdog would compete to improve their strength. The strongest would never be able to reach the same level of determination and open-mindedness as one who is eager to reach new heights of greatness.
                And soon, Zilong also justified this decision through his own actions. Although he was not the most outstanding student, he had a calm and resilient heart, an upright and brave personality, and a kind and selfless character. He was adopted by the Great Dragon, but often posed as an ordinary holy man, helping the people of the Cadia Riverlands through the calamities and hardships brought their way, and aiding them in times of danger and distress.
                These precious qualities possessed by Zilong seeped into the hearts of everyone in the Dragon Altar, and even into the hearts of the people of the Cadia Riverlands, earning him the trust and recognition of all. When Zilong was eighteen years old, the Great Dragon bestowed the Great Dragon Spear upon him, the most prized treasure of the Dragon Altar, in front of everyone. This Dragon Spear, which had witnessed thousands of years of history, not only contained unrivaled power, but also signified that the Great Dragon had formally handed over the responsibility of guarding the Cadia Riverlands to Zilong.
                In the following years, Zilong and his Great Dragon Spear traversed almost every inch of the Cadia Riverlands, defeating the powerful enemies who dared invade the Land of Promise one after another, and thus cementing his reputation as the savior of his people.
                But just when everyone thought that Zilong could truly take over the mantle of the Great Dragon and become a strong and dependable guardian of the Cadia Riverlands, his fated foe, Yu Zhong, appeared on the continent once again.
                Driven mad by ambition, Yu Zhong was banished by the Great Dragon. However, he unexpectedly recovered the reversed scale of the Black Dragon and returned with a vengeance. Under the guidance of the Great Dragon, Zilong, together with Baxia, Ling, and Wanwan, formed the Oriental Fighters, shouldering the heavy responsibility of protecting this peaceful and beautiful land from those who would destroy it.
